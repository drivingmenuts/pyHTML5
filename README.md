# pyHTML5

A library for creating HTML5 files in Python. NOTE: This is a work in progress.

### Notes

To use, import `pyhtml5.py`. All currently valid HTML tags are available (`<A>` has been renamed to `<ANCHOR>`). All
tags are uppercased. All tag properties are prefixed with an underscore.

### Todo

* Convert tags to use Context Management
* HTMX integration
